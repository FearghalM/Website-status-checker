# Website-status-checker
Hello, 
I wanted to bring to your attention a Python script that I find quite useful. This script is designed to extract a list of domains from a CSV file and subsequently visit each one. If the process takes longer than 30 seconds for a particular domain, the script will automatically move on to the next. In addition, it can log any redirect URLs and status in the CSV file. Moreover, it is equipped to handle any errors that may arise during the execution. I believe this feature to be highly beneficial. Thank you for considering this information.
